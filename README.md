# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellations Dashboard

### 👩🏻‍💼 THE SITUATION
The hotel industry is highly competitive, and cancellations can have a significant business impact. Understanding the reasons for cancellations and finding ways to reduce them is essential for maximizing revenue and improving the guest experience. Suppose a hotel manager of a small hotel chain in the Algarve in Portugal is struggling with increasing booking cancellations and hired me as a consultant to tackle this issue. 

### ✏️ THE OBJECTIVE
Create a dashboard that allows for an interactive analysis of booking cancellations. The dashbaord should enable the hotel manager to identify patterns and trends related to cancellations and provide insights into the reasons for cancellations and suggestions for reducing them. Ultimately, the goal is to help the hotel manager improve guest satisfaction and increase revenue by reducing cancellations.
